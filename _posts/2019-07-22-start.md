This is the start of the RÃ¶Blog - the main intentions of this blog is for me to document my experiences becoming a full-fledged data scientist - as well as challenges I face and (try) to overcome on a day-to-day basis. 

A little bit about me - I'm Rohit - I study computer science and statistics at Penn State (graduating May 2020), and I am going into my senior year. This upcoming semester, I'm taking classes related to topics such as deep learning, big data, and time series analysis. I currently work at Goodyear as a data science intern, while simultaneously working at a startup called Partsimony that aims to make the supply chain process more efficient through machine learning - as a machine learning engineer. 

I have a lot of interests specifically in soccer - and so I expect to be trialling a lot of different concepts I continue to learn on this specific domain to maximize the fun I have during the time.

I think data science is a field where there is continuously so much to learn - but that's the beauty of it - data is everywhere, and we as data scientists help to make business decisions or predictions data-driven than by instinct. I'm excited to be in this journey, and I hope any readers can join me in it. Feel free to email me at (rohit AT psu DOT edu) if you'd like to chat more.
