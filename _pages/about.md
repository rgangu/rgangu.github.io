I currently work as a machine learning engineer at Partsimony, and a data science intern at Goodyear.  The main emphasis of this blog is to document and showcase my experiences with data science, and to share the struggles and accomplishments I experience on a day-to-day basis at work, and for fun (side projects!). I aim to, in the long term, work in sports analytics and also pursue my master's degree in a quantitative field. Thanks for checking out my blog, and feel free to check out other parts of my website to view my projects, resume, and more.
