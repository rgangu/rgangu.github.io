 I am a data scientist, with experiences in deep learning and data engineering as well that supplement my main focuses. 
 
The main emphasis of this blog is to document and showcase my experiences with data science, and to share the struggles and accomplishments I experience on a day-to-day basis at work, and for fun (side projects!). 
    
I aim to, in the long term, work in intelligence-based analytics and also pursue my master's degree in something (likely applied maths) that will force me to delve even deeper in an academic context on data science elements.

In this blog, I plan to have articles including and utilizing concepts and techniques from: 

* Data science as it is done in the real world
* Deep learning and some self-research
* Sports analytics, especially in regards to regression and classification applied to soccer
* Natural language processing, particularly in machine translation
* Time-series analysis, especially in regards to stocks and cryptocurrencies
* Kaggle challenges - and my approaches walking through them
* Some bits and pieces of knowledge I gain from work, with pet examples

Thanks for checking out my blog, and feel free to check out other parts of my website to view my projects, resume, and more.
