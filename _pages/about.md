 I currently work as a data engineer.
 
The main emphasis of this blog is to document and showcase my experiences with data science, and to share the struggles and accomplishments I experience on a day-to-day basis at work, and for fun (side projects!). 
    
I aim to, in the long term, work in sports analytics and also pursue my master's degree in a quantitative field. 

In this blog, I plan to have articles including and utilizing concepts and techniques from: 

* Deep learning and some self-research
* Sports analytics, especially in regards to regression and classification applied to soccer
* Natural language processing, particularly in machine translation
* Time-series analysis, especially in regards to stocks and cryptocurrencies
* Kaggle challenges - and my approaches walking through them
* Various school projects, as I venture into my final year 
* Some bits and pieces of knowledge I gain from work, with pet examples

Thanks for checking out my blog, and feel free to check out other parts of my website to view my projects, resume, and more.
